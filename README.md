# A* Pathfinding Algorithm in C++

This project implements the A* pathfinding algorithm in C++. The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal technique used in various applications, including robotics, games, and maps. It is an informed search algorithm, meaning it uses both the actual distance from the start to a node (G cost) and the estimated distance from the node to the goal (H cost) to determine the optimal path.

## Files:

main.cpp: Contains the main logic and functions to perform A* search.

readboard.txt: A text file that contains the grid layout for the pathfinding.

## How to Run

Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable.

The program will output the board with the optimal path from the start to the goal.
